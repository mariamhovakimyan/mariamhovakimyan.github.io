	In the aftermath of the devastating earthquake of 1988 in northern Armenia, the United States National Academy of Sciences dispatched a team of scientists and engineers to then Soviet Armenia to assess the effects of the earthquake and provide technical assistance. The team included two American-Armenians, Mihran Agbabian of the University of Southern California and Armen Der Kiureghian of the University of California (UC), Berkeley, both professors of earthquake engineering.
